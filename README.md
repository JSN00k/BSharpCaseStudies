# BSharpCaseStudies
A series of mathematical objects built in BSharp, and the eventB that they generate.

The B# code is in the Language test folder. The other folders contain the generated rodin files. 
The bsharp files are plain text so can be viewed without issue. To develop in B#  the B# tool will
need to be manually installed. The code for the B# tool is at https://github.com/JSN00k/BSharpSource

The Rodin files can be viewed by installing the Rodin tool, and additionally the Theory Plug-in.
